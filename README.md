# ev_mqtt_monitor
This final year project of mine involves monitoring Electric Vehicle chargers using both MQTT and LoraWan (for public chargers). This repo
contains the Python libraries and scripts for monitoring the GPIO ports and publishing a valid JSON to the AWS IoT core so it can be
enriched and processed further.
